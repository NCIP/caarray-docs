

There are some standard, recommended ways to organize a repository. Most people create a trunk directory
to hold the "main line" of development, a branches directory to contain branch copies, and a
tags directory to contain tag copies. If a repository holds only one project, then often people create
these top-level directories:

	/trunk
	/branches
	/tags
	
If a repository contains multiple projects, admins typically index their layout by project (see the section
called "Choosing a Repository Layout" to read more about "project roots"):

	/paint/trunk
	/paint/branches
	/paint/tags
	/calc/trunk
	/calc/branches
	/calc/tags
	
Of course, you're free to ignore these common layouts. You can create any sort of variation, whatever
works best for you or your team. Remember that whatever you choose, it's not a permanent commitment.
You can reorganize your repository at any time. Because branches and tags are ordinary directories,
the svn move command can move or rename them however you wish. Switching from one layout to
another is just a matter of issuing a series of server-side moves; if you don't like the way things are organized
in the repository, just juggle the directories around.
