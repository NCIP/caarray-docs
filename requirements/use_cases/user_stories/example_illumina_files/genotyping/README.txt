There is a dearth of example files that conform to this prescribed format.
Most files generated by default don't have the mandatory IlmnID.
The GA_illumina* files are GEO's recommendations for how to format processed matrix files.

The GSE11977 SOFT file has sample tables that have data in the prescribed format. Please extract these sample tables in order to test.
Two sample tables have already been extracted:
* sample_GSM302898_from_GSE11977.txt
* sample_GSM302899_from_GSE11977.txt
The platform (array design file) is available for download from GEO. They use the array design HumanHap550v3_B.
