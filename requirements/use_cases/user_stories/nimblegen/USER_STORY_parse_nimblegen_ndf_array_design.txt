USER STORY: Parse Nimblegen ndf array designs

As a Curator or Data Owner, I want to import a Nimblegen array design in ndf format so that the array design can be associated to experiments and data files.

1. Flow:

* The user (Curator or Data Owner) chooses to import a new array design.
* The system allows "Nimblegen NDF" as one of the options for the file type.
* The user chooses the Nimblegen NDF format and selects a file in that format.
* The system parses the file:
  + The NDF array design format is a tab-delimited text file, and describes the placement of probes.
  + These are the columns that are parsed, and they are all mandatory, else the system throws a validation error.
    o CONTAINER: A container is a block. Containers are commonly named BLOCK1, BLOCK2, etc. or FORWARD1, FORWARD2, etc. The container name is typically <=50 characters.
    o SEQ_ID: The NimbleGen sequence identifier, used to group together sets of probes for a gene or region of interest within a design. The Sequence ID is typically <=50 characters.
    o PROBE_ID: The NimbleGen probe identifier, used to identify individual probe sequences within a design. The Probe ID is typically <=50 characters.
    o X: X coordinate of the feature on the image. Integer. The range of this value is typically 1 to 1050.
    o Y: Y coordinate of the feature on the image. Integer. The range of this value is typically 1 to 4200.
  + For each unique X/Y, the system creates a Feature object with Feature.column = <X> and Feature.row = <Y>.
  + For each unique CONTAINER/SEQ_ID/PROBE_ID, the system creates a PhysicalProbe object. The probe name/identifier is "<CONTAINER>|<SEQ_ID>|<PROBE_ID>". The appropriate Feature objects are associated with this PhysicalProbe.
  + For each unique SEQ_ID, the system creates a LogicalProbe object with LogicalProbe.name = "<SEQ_ID>". The appropriate PhysicalProbe objects are associated with this LogicalProbe.
* Note: No probe annotations are available since we don't parse those file formats yet.
* The import fails if any of the above columns is missing.
* If the import passes, the features, physical probes and logical probes are successfully stored in the database.

3. Example files:

Sample Nimblegen NDF files are under nimblegen/example_files/gene_expression/*.ndf and nimblegen/example_files/cgh/*.ndf.
