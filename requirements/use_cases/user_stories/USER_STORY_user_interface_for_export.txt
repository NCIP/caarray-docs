USER STORY: User interface for export

As a caArray user, I want to export my experiment to GEO SOFT or MAGE-TAB format.

1. Flow:

* In the context of an experiment, the user chooses to export to some format.
* The system takes the user to a page that allows the user to export the experiment to GEO SOFT, or to export the experiment into MAGE-TAB format.
* The user chooses to export the experiment to GEO SOFT format, and specifies whether to download only the GEO SOFT file or the entire GEO submission package including the data files.
* The system validates the experiment for GEO export.
* If the validation fails, the System provides the list of errors to the user.
* If the validation succeeds, the Systems performs the GEO translation and provides the GEO SOFT file or the submission package for download.
* The user saves the download to his/her local machine.

Note: the MAGE-TAB export functionality works the same way as it currently does, except that the "Expor Consolidated MAGE-TAB button needs to be moved from the Download Data page to this new Export page.
