USER STORY: Parse Illumina Genotyping Processed Matrix

As a Data Owner, I want to import an Illumina genotyping processed matrix file in TXT format and associate it to biomaterials in the context of a genotyping/SNP/copy number assay type.

1. Flow:

* The user (Data Owner) uploads a file into an experiment and changes the file type to "Illumina genotyping processed matrix TXT".
* The user chooses to import the file (possibly along with other files). Note that just like for Illumina Data CSV files, importing with MAGE-TAB does not make sense for this file type, since the hybridization names are inferred from the file content.
* The system parses and validates the file to make sure:
  + the experiment is of a genotyping/SNP/copy number assay type
  + an array design is associated with the experiment
  + the mandatory columns in section 2 of this user story are present.
  + every IlmnId/ID_REF/ID value in the data file can be correlated to the IlmnID in the array design.

2. Columns expected in the genotyping processed matrix TXT file:

* The "IlmnID"/"ID_REF"/"ID" column is mandatory.
* Case is unimportant in the column names.
* The order of quantitation types (e.g., B_Allele_Freq, Log_R_Ratio etc.) is unimportant.
* Additional columns not described in this section may be present and should be ignored while parsing.
* There are 2 variants re: how the hybridization names are present in the file: "samplename.quantitationtype" or just "quantitationtype". (In the latter case, the hybridization is determined by the last hybridization name column that preceded it.) Both variants should be supported. E.g.:
   ID	HYB1	GC_SCORE 	Theta 	R 	B_Allele_Freq 	Log_R_Ratio	HYB2	GC_SCORE 	Theta 	R 	B_Allele_Freq 	Log_R_Ratio

once in the file:
  IlmnID/ID_REF/ID                  **** mandatory ****
once for each hybridization:
  Value (implicit; there is no explicit quantitation type named in the file; corresponds to the <hyb name> column) **** mandatory ****
  GC_SCORE
  Theta
  R
  B_Allele_Freq
  Log_R_Ratio

3. Implementation Notes:

* Create a new ArrayDataType for the above new quantitation types.
* There is really only one example file that conforms to this prescribed format.
