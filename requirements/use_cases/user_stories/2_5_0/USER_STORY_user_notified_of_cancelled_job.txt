USER STORY: User Notified of Cancelled Job

As the Data Owner of an experiment, I want to be notified when one of my validation or import jobs is cancelled.

1. Flow:

* When someone cancels a validation or import job from the job queue, the system sends out an email to the Data Owner of that experiment.
  + The email has the Subject "caArray experiment <public_identifier> Validation/Import job cancelled."
  + The email body looks like this: "<user_id> cancelled a Validation/Import job for caArray experiment <public_identifier> on <Date_and_Time>."
  + The email comes from the NCICB Systems sender for the NCI instance of caArray, or from the configured sender for a local caArray installation.

2. Acceptance Criteria:

2.1 The owner of the experiment initiates a validation/import job, which gets put in the job queue behind an already-running job. The owner then goes to the Job Queue and cancels the job he/she just initiated. The owner receives an email informing him/her about the cancellation.
2.2 A collaborator with Read+Write access to the experiment initiates a validation/import job, which gets put in the job queue behind an already-running job. The collaborator then goes to the Job Queue and cancels the job he/she just initiated. The owner of the experiment (not the collaborator) receives an email informing him/her about the cancellation.
2.3 The Subject and body of the email has the appropriate values filled in for the user_id of the person who cancelled the job, the public identifier of the experiment involved, and the date and time on which the cancellation occurred.
2.4 When an experiment is cancelled on a local installation of caArray, the Sender of the email is set correctly.
