USER STORY: Search for Experiment by Publication

As a caArray User, I want to be able to search for an experiment by publication criteria like Pubmed ID and publication author.

1. Flow:

* The user (logged in or not) navigates to the Search pane and elects to search for Experiments.
* The system allows the user to choose the search category. In addition to the categories supported so far (Experiment Title, Experiment Id, Array Provider, Array Design etc.), the system allows two new categories - Pubmed ID and Publication Author.
* The user chooses one of the two categories - Pubmed ID or Publication Author.
* The user types in the search text in the Keyword field, or leaves it blank, and starts the Search.
* The system searches for and returns Experiments that have an associated Publication that matches the selected category and keyword.
  + The search is an "anywhere-search" just like for the other categories.
  + The search is case-insensitive just like for the other categories.
  + The search treats the entered keyword as a string enclosed in double quotes, just like for the other categories. E.g., searching for category = Publication Author and keyword = Ye Wu will return results only if the Publication Author list for the experiment has the string "Ye Wu" in it. There are no AND/OR search semantics.

Note: If the user selects Category = "All Categories", then Pubmed ID and Publication Author are included in the set of fields that are searched against.
