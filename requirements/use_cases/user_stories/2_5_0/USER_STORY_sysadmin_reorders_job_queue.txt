USER STORY: System Administrator Reorders Job Queue

As a Systemadministrator, I want to reorder validation and import jobs in the job queue so that I can schedule jobs in order of their importance.

1. Flow:

* On the Job Queue page, for every "In Queue" job, the systemadministrator has the ability to click on the row and drag it to a different position in the job queue (as long as the new position is below the top item which is the currently running job).
  + See the Netflix Queue for an example of how this works.
* The system reorders the job queue accordingly, and displays the new queue.

2. Acceptance Criteria:

2.1 The systemadministrator should not be allowed to drag the first item on the queue -- the job that is already running.
2.2 The systemadministrator should not be allowed to drag an "In Queue" item to the top -- above the currently running job.
2.3 The systemadministrator should be able to drag an "In Queue" item to make its position higher.
2.4 The systemadministrator should be able to drag an "In Queue" item to make its position lower.
2.5 The system should execute the jobs in the final order that the queue was left at.
