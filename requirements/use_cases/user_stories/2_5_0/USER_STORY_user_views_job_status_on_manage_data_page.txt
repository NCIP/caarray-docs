USER STORY: User Views Job Status on Manage Data Page

As a Data Owner or a Collaborator with Read or Read/Write access to an experiment, I want to view the position of my validation and import jobs in the job queue, so that I can manage my jobs.

1. Flow:

* A Data Owner or a Collaborator with Read or Read/Write access navigates to the Manage Data page of an experiment.
* One or more validation/import jobs have been requested for that experiment, but are still in the queue. That is, some of the files are in the "In Queue" state.
* For the "In Queue" files, the system displays the position of the corresponding validation or import job in the Status column. E.g., "In Queue (#3)".
* When the user clicks on the "In Queue (#3)" link, the system displays the Job Queue page, which is further described in the User Story: User Views Job Queue.
* When the user clicks on the "Refresh" button, the status is updated to reflect the current queue position of the "In Queue" items.

2. Acceptance Criteria:

2.1 The Data Owner of an experiment should be able to see the queue position of files in the "In Queue" status on the Manage Data page for that experiment.
2.2 A Collaborator who has Read access to an experiment should be able to see the queue position of files in the "In Queue" status on the Manage Data page for that experiment. (Note: this test will not work until the collaborator group defect is fixed.)
2.3 A Collaborator who has Read+Write access to an experiment should be able to see the queue position of files in the "In Queue" status on the Manage Data page for that experiment. (Note: this test will not work until the collaborator group defect is fixed.)
2.4 Clicking on the "In Queue (<position>)" link should take the user to the Job Queue page.
2.5 When the position of a job moves up (say from #3 to #2), clicking on the Refresh button should update the status, say from "In Queue (#3)" to "In Queue (#2).
2.6 The owner of the experiment starts 2 validation/import jobs for the same experiment, and they both go on the queue. The files associated with the first job should display the correct queue position, e.g., "In Queue (#2)", and the files associated with the second job should display a different queue position, e.g., "In Queue (#3)".
