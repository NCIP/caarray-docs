USER STORY: Support Affymetrix AGCC exon files

As a Curator or Data Owner, I want to import Affymetrix AGCC CEL and CHP files into an exon experiment in caArray so that the data values can be parsed and associated with probe sets.

1. Flow:
* The flow is the same as the current data file import of CEL and CHP files in an exon experiment, but see Section 2 for the specific format of AGCC CEL and CHP files from exon assays.
* Note: The Affy library we use for parsing Affymetrix files should be upgraded to Affx Fusion 1.1.0.

2. Formats:
CEL:
* We already parse the CEL files correctly. No changes are required here.

CHP:
* For general CHP file parsing, see USER STORY: Support Affymetrix AGCC CHP Files.
* There are 2 variants of Exon CHP files requiring 2 Fusion classes:
  + RMA/PLIER algorithm: FusionCHPQuantificationData (This format is already parsed correctly as described in USER STORY: Support Affymetrix AGCC CHP Files.)
  + RMA/PLIER with DABG detection type: FusionCHPQuantificationDetectionData (The parser needs to be enhanced to support this format.)
* The FusionCHPQuantificationDetectionData variant has the same probe set id and quantification value as the FusionCHPQuantificationData variant. But in addition, the FusionCHPQuantificationDetectionData variant also has a detection p-value which is a float.
* See example C++ code for parsing the 2 variants here:
http://www.affymetrix.com/partners_programs/programs/developer/whitepapers/parsing_wt_chp_files.affx#1_4


3. Example files:

* Look under example_files/exon/AGCC/ for CEL and CHP files in AGCC format.
  + CHP: FusionCHPQuantificationData variant: TisMix_Exon_CHP.study/TisMix_mix9_03_v1_Exon1.rma-gene-core.chp, HuEx-1_0-st-v2.colon-cancer-data-set.study/1_1T.rma-gene-core.chp
  + CHP: FusionCHPQuantificationDetectionData variant: HuEx-1_0-st-v2.colon-cancer-data-set.study/*dabg.chp
