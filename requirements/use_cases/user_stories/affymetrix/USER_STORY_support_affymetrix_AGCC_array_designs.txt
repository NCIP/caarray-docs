USER STORY: Support Affymetrix AGCC array designs

As a Curator or Data Owner, I want to import Affymetrix AGCC array
designs into caArray so that these designs can be associated to
experiments and data files.

1. Flow:
* The flow is the same as the current array design import of CDF files.
* Note: The Affy library we use for parsing Affymetrix files should be
  upgraded to Affx Fusion 1.1.0.

2. Array design formats:
* The old ASCII format is currently unsupported, and also outdated. We
  don't have to support it.
* The GCOS 1.2 and 1.3 binary format (version XDA 1): Fusion 1.1 should
  parse all these seamlessly. We need to test with the CDF files provided
  under example_files/array_design/GCOS/.
* The Command Console binary format (versions 1, 2, 3): Fusion 1.1
  should parse all these seamlessly; test with the CDF files provided
  under example_files/array_design/AGCC_2.x and AGCC_3.x. (An example file
  for version 1 is not available.)
