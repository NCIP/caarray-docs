USER STORY: Support Affymetrix CNCHP files

As a Curator or Data Owner, I want to import Affymetrix CNCHP files into caArray so that copy number and LOH data can be parsed and associated with probe sets.

1. Flow:
* The flow is the same as the current data file import of CHP files, but the parser should be able to read the CHP file and parse it differently depending on the file format.
* Note: The Affy library we use for parsing Affymetrix files should be upgraded to Affx Fusion 1.1.0.
* Note: caIntegrator2 has a parser for this format; look to reuse their code.

2. CNCHP file formats:
These are level 2 derived data files containing copy number and (optionally) LOH data.
They are specific to the new Command Console format and are not applicable to the old GCOS format.

The algorithm used can be CN4 or CN5.
* CN4
       The Copy Number analysis results from CN4 are stored in a single group with a single data set.
       The data type identifier is set to: "affymetrix-multi-data-type-analysis"
       The data group containing the analysis results is called "MultiData".
       The results are stored in a data set named "CopyNumber" which will contain the following columns:
       + ProbeSetName: String
       + Chromosome: UByte; 1-22, 24 (for X), 25 (for Y) and 26 (for MT) and 255 (for no value)
       + Position: UInt
       + CNState: UByte
       + Log2Ratio: float
       + HmmMedianLog2Ratio: float
       + NegLog10PValue: float
       + ChipNum: UByte
* CN5
       The Copy Number and Loss of Heterozygosity results generated by CN5 are stored in one file in a single group with a single data set.
       The data type identifier is set to: "affymetrix-multi-data-type-analysis"
       The data group containing the analysis results is called "MultiData".
       The results are stored in a data set named "CopyNumber" which will contain the following columns:
       + ProbeSetName: String
       + Chromosome: UByte; 1-22, 24 (for X), 25 (for Y) and 26 (for MT) and 255 (for no value)
       + Position: UInt
       + CNState: float  .... (this was UByte in CN4??)
       + Log2Ratio: float
       + SmoothSignal: float [optional]
       + LOH: float
       + Allele Difference: float
