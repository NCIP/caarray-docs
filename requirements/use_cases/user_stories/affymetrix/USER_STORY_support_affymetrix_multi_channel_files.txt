USER STORY: Support Affymetrix multi-channel files

As a Curator or Data Owner, I want to import Affymetrix multi-channel CDF, CEL and CHP files into caArray so that data from multi-channel experiments can be parsed and associated with probe sets.
Note that this user story may be deferred from release 2.4.0 because this is a new format that was introduced in late 2009, and example files are hard to come by yet.

1. Multi-channel CEL files:

The multi-channel CEL file, like the original CEL file, stores the results of the intensity calculations on the pixel values of the DAT file.
Unlike the original CEL file, the multi-channel CEL file stores the results in groups associated with each channel (i.e. wavelength) in the file.
Each channel in the multi-channel CEL file includes an intensity value, standard deviation of the intensity, the number of pixels used to calculate the intensity value, a flag to indicate an outlier as calculated by the algorithm and a user defined flag indicating the feature should be excluded from future analysis. (The file stores this data for each feature on the probe array.)

The intensity data is stored in multiple groups; one group per channel (i.e. wavelength).
A multi-channel CEL file with 4 channels would, e.g., have 4 groups of these data sets.
Each group will be named according to their wavelength and will contain 5 data sets: (The definitions of the data sets are the same as that in single channel CEL files)

1. Intensity
FLOAT
The intensity value. The row order is the same as defined in the GCOS CEL file.

2. StdDev
FLOAT
The standard deviation value. The row order is the same as defined in the GCOS CEL file.

3. Pixel
SHORT
The pixel count value. The row order is the same as defined in the GCOS CEL file.

4. Outlier: 2 columns (X and Y)
SHORT
The X/Y coordinates of those features called as outliers by the algorithm.

5. Mask: 2 columns (X and Y)
SHORT
The X/Y coordinates of the user masked features.

Functions added to the Fusion layer of the SDK in support of multi-channel CEL files include the following:
    * IsMultiColor() will return true if the CEL file has multiple channels and false if it has one channel.
    * GetChannels() will return a list of channel (data group) names stored in the CEL file.
    * SetActiveDataGroup(const std::wstring &groupName) sets the active data group for a multi-channel CEL file. Data returned in subsequent calls to the CEL file will be based on the active data group.
The data type identifier is set to "affymetrix-calvin-multi-intensity".

2. Multi-channel CDF files:

Like those supporting the single-channel microarrays, CDF files for multi-channel microarrays are in XDA file format. The file version for multi-channel CDF files is set to 3.

Functions added to the Fusion SDK in support of the multi-channel microarray format:
    * The function GetChannel() has been added to the class FusionCDFProbeGroupInformation to return the channel of a probe group.
    * The probeset type (UnitType) MultichannelMarker has been added to the class FusionCDFProbeGroupInformation
    * A field to define the probe replication of a group has been added to the class FusionCDFProbeGroupInformation.  This field is available in CDF files in version 3 format only.
    * The function GetRepType() has been added to return the replication type of a probe group.

3. Example files:

None found, probably because this is a new format that was introduced in late 2009. Need to contact Affymetrix for example files.
