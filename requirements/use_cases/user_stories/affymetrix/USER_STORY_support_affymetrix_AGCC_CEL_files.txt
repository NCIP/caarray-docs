USER STORY: Support Affymetrix AGCC CEL files

As a Curator or Data Owner, I want to import Affymetrix AGCC CEL files
into caArray so that the data values can be parsed and associated with
probe sets.

1. Flow:
* The flow is the same as the current data file import of CEL files, but
  the parser should be able to read the CHP file and parse it differently
  depending on the file format.
* Note: The Affy library we use for parsing Affymetrix files should be
  upgraded to Affx Fusion 1.1.0.

2. CEL file formats:
* The old ASCII format is currently unsupported, and also outdated. We
  don't have to support it.
* The GCOS binary/XDA format (version 1): Fusion 1.1 should parse this;
  test with the CEL files provided under
  example_files/gene_expression/GCOS*/.
* The Command Console/AGCC/Calvin format (version 1): Fusion 1.1 should
  parse this; test with the CEL files provided under
  example_files/gene_expression/AGCC. Quantitation types are the same as
  for GCOS.

3. Fusion library:

The top level Fusion object to use is FusionCELData.
The CEL file contains intensity data organized by X/Y feature coordinate.
Included in the file is the name of the algorithm and the parameters used to create the file.

The workflow for reading a CEL file is:
   1. Create a FusionCELData object.
   2. Set the full path name of the input CEL file using the SetFileName() function.
   3. Read the file using the Read() function. A false boolean value may be
      passed into the function if mask and outlier data are not to be read.
   4. Use the GetParameters() function to retrieve the list of algorithm parameters.
   5. Use the GetAlg() function to retrieve the name of the algorithm used to create the CEL file.
   6. Use GetEntry() to retrieve the intensity, standard deviation and
      pixel count for a given feature; OR GetIntensity() to retrieve just the
      intensity value.

4. Example files:

* Look under example_files/gene_expression for CEL files from different versions of GCOS and AGCC.
